00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
John Smith: Good morning everyone, welcome to our weekly team standup meeting.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Sarah Johnson: Thanks John! I'm excited to share that I completed the user authentication feature yesterday.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
John Smith: That's excellent news Sarah! The authentication was a critical piece. How did the testing go?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Sarah Johnson: Testing went really well. All edge cases are covered and the code is ready for review.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
John Smith: Perfect. Mike, can you review Sarah's pull request by Friday?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Mike Chen: Absolutely, I'll have the code review completed by end of day Thursday.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Sarah Johnson: Thanks Mike! After this is merged, I'll start working on the dashboard analytics feature next week.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Mike Chen: I wanted to bring up something concerning. We've been seeing some performance issues during load testing.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Mike Chen: The response times are slower than expected when we have more than 100 concurrent users.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
John Smith: That's definitely concerning Mike. We need to address this before the launch. Can you put together a detailed analysis?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Mike Chen: Yes, I'll document the performance metrics and potential bottlenecks by Monday.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
John Smith: Great. Let's also schedule a dedicated meeting to discuss performance optimizations. Sarah, can you send out a calendar invite?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Sarah Johnson: Sure thing! I'll send the invite for next Tuesday at 2 PM. Will that work for everyone?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Mike Chen: Tuesday at 2 works for me.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
John Smith: Perfect for me too. Anything else we need to cover today?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Sarah Johnson: Just wanted to mention that the design team shared the new mockups yesterday. They look amazing!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
John Smith: Wonderful! The design team has been doing fantastic work. Let's make sure we review those in our next planning session.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Mike Chen: Agreed. I'm really happy with how the project is coming together, despite the performance challenges.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
John Smith: Great attitude Mike. We'll tackle these issues together. Thanks everyone for the great work!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Sarah Johnson: Thanks John! Have a great rest of the week everyone.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Mike Chen: You too! See you all next week.
