John Smith: Good morning everyone. Let's start our quarterly review meeting. We have a lot to cover today.

Sarah Johnson: Thanks John. I'd like to start by discussing our Q3 performance. We've seen a 15% increase in revenue compared to Q2.

Michael Chen: That's great news! I think our new marketing strategy really paid off. The social media campaigns were particularly effective.

John Smith: Excellent work team. What about the product development side?

Emily Davis: We've made significant progress on the new feature set. The beta testing is scheduled for next month. We're currently addressing some minor bugs.

Sarah Johnson: Do we have enough resources allocated for the beta testing phase?

Emily Davis: Yes, we've assigned three QA engineers full-time. I'm confident we'll be ready.

Michael Chen: I want to highlight that customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our NPS score increased by 12 points.

John Smith: That's fantastic. What are our next steps?

Sarah Johnson: We need to finalize the Q4 budget. I propose increasing the marketing budget by 20% to capitalize on our momentum.

Emily Davis: I agree. We should also consider hiring two more developers to maintain our development velocity.

Michael Chen: Makes sense. I'll work with HR to start the recruitment process.

John Smith: Perfect. Let's schedule a follow-up meeting next week to review the budget proposal. Emily, can you prepare a detailed development timeline?

Emily Davis: Absolutely. I'll have it ready by Wednesday.

Sarah Johnson: I'll also prepare the financial projections for Q4.

John Smith: Excellent. Thank you everyone for your hard work. Let's keep up the momentum!
