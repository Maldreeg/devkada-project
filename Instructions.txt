Goal: Develop a web with AI Agent, its purpose is to summerize meetings (Zoom, Microsoft Teams) and
it is context dependent, meaning it understand what the meeting is about, the web app can also have an input of name and a their positionn in a Team
that way, not only it summarize the the meeting but also knows to assign the role depending on the meeting

INPUTS:
the transcript file(.txt or .vtt)
chatlogs
attachments(documents/powerpoints/pdf)
Customization Options: Allow users to customize summary formats (e.g., bullet points, narrative style) and the level of detail based on their preferences or company standards.

OUTPUTS:
Summary of the meeting, and names of the people and their tasks(Topic Segmentation, Speaker Intent Detection, Knowledge Graph Building)
    - connect to google calendar ONLY IF there are dates mentioned,
Behavior Analysis(Sentiment Analysis, Engagement Heat Map): Analyze the tone of the discussions to provide insights into the overall sentiment of the meeting, which can help gauge team morale and engagement.
    -Perform tool call. For sentiment analysis with either 80+ (positive) and -80 (negative) - it should send an email to those participants. If positive - say congrats! If negative - say how they are feeling.
Visual Summaries: Generate visual representations of the meeting outcomes, such as mind maps or infographics, to complement the text summary.
Integrations with Collaboration Tools: Connect with tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Asana to share summaries and action items directly within the platforms teams already use.

Use free open source platform/APIs and make it lightweight and easier to run
But I think I prefer backend is python and react.js for frontend
